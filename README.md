- Improve than ver 1, instead using email like primary key of listTodo
- in ver 2, task can store independently directly in localStorage
- When we use query, simply using user_id (id of user) like the
- foreign key to filter tasks to take array task
- And easily add new task more than ver 1
- we don't need to check if user exist / user created task yet
- just add new task, who add task then give lil task a credential
- property is user_id with value is user.id
